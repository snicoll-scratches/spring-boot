An issue will be closed as a duplicate of the immediate pull request, so you don't have to
raise an issue if you plan to create a pull request immediately.

Please start by describing the problem that you are trying to solve. There may already
be a solution, or there may be a way to solve it that you hadn't considered.

TIP: You can always edit your issue if it isn't formatted correctly.
